This is a collection of three projects that were created for the `System Programming` Course of 2020 (Informatics and Telecommunications - NKUoA).

The first project is essentially the creation of all the structures and basic functions that will be needed in the following projects. It features a [bloom filter](https://github.com/konstantinosbakos/bloom_filter) and a [skip list](https://github.com/konstantinosbakos/skip_list) tailored to the needs of the project.

The second project explores the communication between `processes` via `named pipes`. The user communicates with a parent process that then distributes the work load to many child processes with which it communicates via the named pipes.

The third project has the same functionalities as the second, but explores the communication between processes via `sockets` and the use of `threads`.
